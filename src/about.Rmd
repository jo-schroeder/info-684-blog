# About

Hello! I'm Joanna. I'm a Master's student in Library and Information Science at Drexel University. This website was created for the class INFO 684 Resources for Young Adults, taught by Professor Genive Purchase. 

<br>
Please explore my blog posts, which discuss a variety genres and mediums. I had a lot of fun putting together this project! I hope you encounter a new or interesting story, voice, or perspective on this website.
