  Ghosts follows Catrina’s move with her family from sunny southern California to the windy, coastal town of Bahía de la Luna in northern California. Cat is not pleased with the change of scenery, leaving behind her old life and friends. Her family had to move, though, because Cat’s sister, Maya, has cystic fibrosis.
