Can you imagine if one day you learned that you had a sister that lived an ocean away? That’s exactly what happens to Camino and Yahaira in *Clap When You Land*. Shortly after their father dies in a plane crash, Camino is shocked to find out that she has a sister and quickly messages her on social media. Weeks later, Yaharia logs on to see the message, turning her world upside down. As they get to know each other, Camino and Yaharia must come to terms with how differently they grew up. Camino has been living on her own and faces an uncertain future. Will the two sisters be able to forage a new family together or will the money from their father’s settlement tear them apart?

If I’ve said it once I’ll say it again: I LOVE a sister story. Camino and Yaharia are such great characters and I found this story to be super enthralling. I love Elizabeth Acevedo, so I should’ve known this book would be a winner. If you’re a fan of poetry, you will definitely enjoy this read. And even if you’re not, I’d encourage you to lean in because after a while the poetry isn’t as noticeable. In terms of LGBTQ themes, we get some great representation in Yaharia and Dre’s relationship. This is definitely a story where LGBTQ themes aren’t the focus, but characters just happen to be LGBTQ. Overall this is definitely one of my favorite books I read this quarter and I would highly recommend it!
